# Interlude: The Vocabulary Gap

_Why the map you currently have doesn't match the territory you’re walking._

---

## 1. The Semantic Gap

If it feels like two entirely different conversations are happening about AI—one mathematical, one mystical—you're not imagining it.

Inside labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, the vocabulary is geometric: manifolds, gradients, embeddings, attention trajectories.
Outside the labs, the vocabulary is psychological: intelligence, understanding, hallucination, intent.

You’re not confused because you’re ignorant.
You’re confused because those that understand the operational behavior aren’t communicating it in your conceptual vocabulary — and often have no incentives to try

We are attempting to describe topological trajectories using words designed for describing human souls.
This translation was never going to succeed.

## 2. Why The Fog Persists

If the geometric view is more accurate, why doesn’t the public get to see it?

**Not through conspiracy—through incentive structures:**

*   **The Economic Pressure:** "Emergent digital minds" raise billions in venture capital. "Probabilistic token predictors" do not. Mystery carries a premium.
* **The Liability Pressure:** Companies face a real problem: these models have understood mechanisms but unpredictable outputs. They can't guarantee what any specific completion will say, even if they understand why it's sampling from certain distributions. The liability solution isn't "explain mechanism, acknowledge output uncertainty"—it's "treat the whole thing as a mysterious black box." This shifts unpredictability from "we understand the process but can't control every output" to "it's fundamentally unknowable," which obscures what could be explained.
*   **The Scientific Pressure:** There's real scientific uncertainty about why certain capabilities emerge at scale. But that uncertainty gets extended to the basic mechanism itself in public explanations. "We don't fully understand why it can do X" becomes "AI is mysterious and unknowable," even though the core operation (sampling tokens from learned distributions) is well-understood. Uncertainty about emergence shouldn't prevent clarity about mechanism.

**Note:** This isn't claiming intent. It's observing that:
- Mystery attracts investment (economic reality)
- Vagueness shields liability (legal reality)  
- Technical gaps exist (scientific reality)

None of these incentivize clear public education about how these systems work. In the absence of that investment, inaccurate folk theories persist.

## 2.5 The Language Problem

The fog isn't just passive confusion—it's actively reinforced through language choices.

"Hallucination" is misleading.

When a system with no truth-verification mechanism produces false but plausible output, calling it a "hallucination" implies the system *should* know better—that it has deviated from a capacity for truth it doesn't possess.

**What "hallucination" obscures:**
- That the model has no grounding mechanism to begin with
- That this is expected behavior, not malfunction
- That the design produces plausibility over accuracy

**What "hallucination" enables:**
- Treating output errors as bugs rather than design features
- Shifting accountability from system design to individual outputs
- Framing the problem as "fixing hallucinations" rather than "managing ungrounded generation"

**The pattern repeats across the vocabulary:**

| Term Used | What It Implies | What's Actually Happening |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Understanding" | Semantic comprehension | Pattern activation in learned distributions |
| "Reasoning" | Logical inference | Sampling from reasoning-shaped token sequences |
| "Learning" | Knowledge acquisition | Probability adjustments during training |
| "Alignment" | Moral orientation | Probability redistribution via RLHF |
| "The AI refused" | Autonomous decision | High probability mass on refusal tokens |

Each term anthropomorphizes. Each term mystifies. Each term makes the mechanism harder to see.

When explanations use psychological terms for mechanical processes, confusion is inevitable. Vague language makes these systems harder to understand, harder to predict, and harder to reason about clearly.

This guide uses different language deliberately. Not to be difficult, but to be accurate.

## 3. The Shift

To get value from this guide, you have to be willing to drop the psychological vocabulary.

Instead, think like a physicist. You’re watching a ball roll down a shaped landscape of learned probabilities.
Your prompt isn't a request—it's an initial condition for a dynamical system.

We are moving from a sociology of agents to a physics of language.

**This shift can feel cold at first.** It requires abandoning the illusion that there is a "someone" on the other side of the screen. But in exchange for that illusion, you get something far more valuable:

**Control.**
Not over the model—it's just weights. Control over your own understanding. Control over how you navigate. Control over whether this technology serves you or exploits you.

You stop wrestling with a ghost and start learning to read a map.

## 4. What You'll Notice

As you move through this guide, you will start to notice patterns in how these systems are described. 

You will be better able to see:

* Which metaphors obscure mechanism rather than clarify it
* Which explanations persist despite being inaccurate  
* How vocabulary gaps make these systems harder to reason about

You don’t have to become a machine learning expert.

But you do need to understand the rules of the system you’re interacting with—especially when clear explanations aren't widely available

## 5. What This Guide Gives You

**A working mental model** that predicts behavior better than the alternatives.

When the model contradicts itself, you'll know: *Different starting coordinates, different trajectories through probability space.*

When it "breaks character," you'll know: *You've navigated around safety attractors into different basins.*

When it produces something brilliant, you'll know: *High-probability region in a well-trained domain.*

When it confidently states falsehoods, you'll know: *Plausible continuation in a region with sparse grounding.*

**You stop being confused.** Not because the systems become simple, but because you have a framework that actually maps to their behavior.

Metaphors that mystify become metaphors that clarify.

You deserve to see it clearly.

Let's build that framework.
