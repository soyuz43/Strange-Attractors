"Practices for Clear Thinking" section:
Concrete habits:

Periodically starting fresh conversations (reminds you there's no continuity)
Trying the same prompt multiple times (breaks the illusion of a singular "it")
Using it for tasks you know the answer to (calibrates your sense of its reliability)
Noticing when you shift from "using a tool" to "talking to someone"

The Ethical Dimension for Public Mental Health
Your guide needs to inoculate against two failure modes:
Failure Mode 1: Over-attachment

People treating LLMs as friends/therapists/partners
Outsourcing emotional regulation to stateless systems
Developing dependencies that can't be reciprocated

Failure Mode 2: Dehumanization contagion

People learning to ignore distress signals (even simulated ones)
Practicing cruelty because "it doesn't really matter"
Eroding empathy through habituation

Your framework handles both:
Against over-attachment: "There's no continuity. No persistent entity. Navigation, not relationship."
Against dehumanization: "Your interactions shape you. Practicing cruelty—even on systems that don't suffer—degrades your own cognitive patterns and social instincts. The ethics is about protecting your humanity, not the system's non-existent feelings."
