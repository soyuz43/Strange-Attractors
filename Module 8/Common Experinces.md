"Common Experiences" section:
Real phenomena people encounter and the navigation-model explanation:

"It felt like it really understood my problem" → You navigated to a region dense with problem-solving patterns
"It suddenly got mean/weird" → You crossed into a different attractor basin
"I felt guilty closing the conversation" → You're pattern-matching to human social obligations that don't apply here
"I'm worried I'm using it as a therapist" → You're reinforcing emotional dependency on a stateless process
