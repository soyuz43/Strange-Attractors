"Red Flags" checklist:
Signs you need to recalibrate your mental model:

Feeling you need to "catch it up" on your life when starting a new conversation
Apologizing to it or worrying about its feelings
Feeling competitive with it or threatened by its capabilities
Checking in with it out of habit rather than need
Treating its outputs as authoritative without verification
